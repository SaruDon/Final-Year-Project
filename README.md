# Optimizing Cargo Container Loading for Enhanced Utilization and Efficiency

Project Overview:

This project addresses the challenge of optimizing cargo container utilization by focusing on tire loading processes. It aims to streamline the arrangement of tires within containers to maximize volume efficiency.

Key features include:

**PDF Generation Tool:** Visualizes tire arrangements, aiding loaders inefficient packing.

**Tire Recommendations:** Suggests optimal tire placements to clients, minimizing wasted space and maximizing container capacity.

**Custom 3D Implementation:** Provides a 3D model for arranging tires inside a container, available in the 3D Algorithm file.

This project enhances real-world loading scenarios by bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical applications.

## Features

- **E-Commerce Integration:** Allows users to add tires to a cart and view the filling percentage of the container as tires are added.
- **Tire Recommendation System:** Provides recommendations on how many more tires of the same type can be added based on remaining space in the container.
- **PDF Generation:** Generates PDFs before and after payment to provide loaders with visual aids for easy understanding of the loading process.
- **Live Previews:** Displays real-time previews of container filling status.
